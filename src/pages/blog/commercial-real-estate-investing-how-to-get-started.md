**Office Buildings:**

Offices are one of the most favorite assets targeted by real estate investors. Before making investments in any office buildings, it is essential to know that there are three different classifications of offices: Class A, B, and C. Class A is where the buildings are freshly built or renovated, with many perks available. Class B is where the buildings are older, and a few changes are required to recondition the structure to make it look appealing and upgraded. Class C is where many investments are supposed to be made for building proper infrastructure. Also, the area is not very pleasing to work in.

**Retail Properties:**

Retail includes many buildings and assets that could be used for commercial real estate investing. These include various shopping malls and eateries such as restaurants. Also, commercial community centers and banks are part of retail.

**Industrial Areas:**

Industries not only include large production sites such as factories with a lot of machinery and workforce but also include warehouses. These places are mainly used for docking, stuffing valuables, and manufacturing, so they work as both production sites and storage units.

**Multi-Family:**

Single-family housing mainly lies under residential real estate, but multi-family is mainly constituted under commercial real estate. It includes apartments or condominiums. The housing can be commercialized if it consists of more than four units.

**Special Purpose:**

Special-purpose consists of a long list of properties. Schools serve as commercial property that lies under special purpose real estate. Besides, hotels and airports, which are part of the tourism industry, also lie in this domain. Moreover, huge sports stadiums, amusement parks, storage facilities, and car washes are also part of the special purpose real estate.
