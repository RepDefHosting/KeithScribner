Investors keep generating huge sums by applying tested and professional real estate investment strategies. These strategies depend upon the investors' funding, experience, and risk tolerance.

**Core:**

Core investing is the least risky form of commercial real estate investing strategy. Knowing that any investment strategy could not be 100% risk-free, Core investing is still the safest. Core relies on purchasing and holding vital assets with remarkable quality, high occupancy rate, stable market, and core location. Such characteristics add value to your property and help you attain the utmost benefits. Investors using core strategy prioritize monthly yield over property appreciation, whose primary rationale for investing is a stable income flow through Class A buildings. The internal rate of return is also low for Core investing, below 10%, due to fewer risk factors. According to the statistics in 2016, the core investment strategy is seen to be used by almost half the population of investors.

**Core Plus:**

As the name suggests, Core Plus is similar to a core investment strategy. However, this is more associated with this investment, where value is added to it for greater financial returns. Core plus investors look for highly durable assets that are sound investments by making slight changes or minimal renovations. However, the risks associated with such investment strategies are comparatively higher due to the high probability of the expiry of lease agreements. Due to the risks associated and further changes required to enhance the property, the Core plus investment strategy is the least used strategy among all investors.

**Value Added:**

A Value-added investment strategy is exceptionally high in terms of associated risks and financial returns. Such an investment strategy mainly emphasizes significant changes to the asset, such as the complete renovation of the property and repositioning for massive income generation. Investors using a value-added approach keep a property for more than five years to implement their strategy and analyze the financial returns through property appreciation. Leasing agreements are part of this strategy, and when selling the property, strong marketing skills are exhibited to obtain higher selling prices.

**Opportunistic:**

The Opportunistic Strategy ought to produce maximum rewards bearing the most significant risks among all the investment strategies. The investors execute a lot of effort and work regarding renovation needs and lowering the vacancy rate, making it the most rewarding investment. Also, the asset is not sold for 3-7 years and has the most incredible internal rate of return.
