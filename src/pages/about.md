  A prominent presence in the Spokane, Washington, business community, [Keith
  Scribner](https://www.keithscribner.co/) through Keith R Scribner Trust is
  principle to many lucrative real estate investment companies. Since his early
  20s, he has been involved in purchasing, rehabilitating, developing, and
  leasing diverse properties that include commercial developments and retail and
  office centers. Although Mr. Scribner has sold numerous completed projects, he
  has retained the most attractive and well-situated properties for continued
  investment portfolio oversight.


  Over the past 14 years, Mr. Scribner has undertaken a full renovation of an early 20th century Georgian revival home that was originally built in 1910 for railroad tycoon George Odell. The nearly 10,000 square feet mansion resembles the White House and is situated on 2.5 acres in Spokane's historic South Hill district. Mr. Scribner has converted the top floor ballroom into a cinema, as well as a games area featuring billiards. Keith Scribner provides support to a number of ongoing community historic preservation efforts, including those involving the Davenport Hotel and the Fox Theatre.
